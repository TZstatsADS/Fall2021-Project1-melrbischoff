### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: The Men and Women of Philosophy: A Comparison
+ This project is conducted by Melissa Bischoff

+ Project summary: Women philosophers weren't around for a long time (published, at least). A majority of the most famous philosophy texts that exist are written by men. In this report, I will take a look at the men and women of philosophy and how they compare to eachother in terms of sentiment, and content overlap.

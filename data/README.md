# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

The `philosophy_data.csv` dataset should be uploaded on your local machine. The file `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt` are necessary for the senitment analysis.

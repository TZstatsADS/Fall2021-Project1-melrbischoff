### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ **The Men and Women of Philosophy: Writing and Written About**
+ This project is conducted by Melissa Bischoff

+ Project summary: Women philosophers weren't around for a long time (published, at least). A majority of the most famous philosophy texts that exist are written by men. In this report, I will compare the texts written by the men and women of philosophy, and texts written about them such as biographies and reviews. Comparison techniques used are sentiment analysis and content overlap.
